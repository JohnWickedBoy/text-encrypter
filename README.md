# Type of Encryption
This program uses symmetric ASCII encryption technique and file format encryption technique to encrypt the user data.

# Usage
After compilation, the user gets a prompt to choose   
Press 1 for Encrypting     
Press 2 for Decrypting      
Press 3 for Exiting the App      
When the Encryption option is chosen, the user is asked to enter the filename. After the file is chosen, the app uses its in-built algorithm to encrypt the file and stores it in filename.en format. The filename.en is completely unreadable by any software except this file encryptor app. 
While Decrypting, the filename.en file is chosen and the data inside it is decrypted back to machine-readable format. 
 
# Supported File Formats
filename.txt    
filename.en
